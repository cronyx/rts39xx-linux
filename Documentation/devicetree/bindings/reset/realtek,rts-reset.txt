RTS3903 Reset Controller
=============================================================================

This binding describes a reset controller device that is used to force reset
individual IP blocks within the RTS3903 SoC using "force reset" control bits
found in the RTS3903 SoC System controller registers.

Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt
for common reset controller binding usage.

Required properties:

- compatible: Contains "realtek,rts3903-reset"

- #reset-cells: Contains 1

Example:

	reset: reset-controller@18860000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3903-reset";
		reg = <0x18860000 0x10000>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

Specifying reset control of devices
=======================================

Device nodes should specify the reset channel required in their "resets"
property, containing a phandle to the RTS3903 reset device node and an
index specifying which reset to use, as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt.

Example:

	crypto: crypto@18600000 {
		...
		resets = <&reset FORCE_RESET_CIPHER>;
		reset-names = "rst";
		...
	};

Macro definitions for the supported resets can be found in:
include/dt-bindings/reset/rts-resets.h
