Realtek I2C Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "realtek,rts3903-i2c"
- reg: Address range of the i2c registers
- interrupt: Should contain the i2c interrupt number
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- clocks: Clock for i2c controller
- clock-names: Name of clock
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs, one pair for
  each reset signal that affects the device.
- reset-names: List of reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as
  the resets property.

Example:

	i2c: i2c@0x18880000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3903-i2c";
		reg = <0x18880000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <BSP_IRQ_OTHERS>;
		interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
		clocks = <&clks RLX_CLK_I2C_CK>;
		clock-names = "i2c_ck";
		resets = <&reset FORCE_RESET_I2C>;
		reset-names = "reset-i2c";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
