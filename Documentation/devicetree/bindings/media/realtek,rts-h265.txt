* Realtek H265 controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "realtek,rts3913-vpucodec"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Phandle of the parent interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain the h265 interrupt number
- clocks: List of clock for H265 controller
- clock-names: List of clock name strings sorted in the same order as
the clocks property
- clock-frequency : List of clock frequency sorted in the same order as
the clocks property
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs, one pair for
each reset signal that affects the device
- reset-names: List of reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as
the resets property


Example:
	rts_h265_vpucodec@0x180c0000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3913-vpucodec";
		reg = <0x180c0000 0x00040000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vecintc>;
		interrupts = <BSP_IRQ_H265>;
		clocks = <&clks RLX_CLK_H265_CK>, \
				<&clks RLX_CLK_H265_ACLK_CK>, \
				<&clks RLX_CLK_H265_BCLK_CK>, \
				<&clks RLX_CLK_H265_CCLK_CK>;
		clock-names = "h265_ck", "h265_aclk_ck", \
				"h265_bclk_ck", "h265_cclk_ck";
		clock-frequency = <0 0 120000000 120000000>;
		resets = <&reset FORCE_RESET_H265_AXI>, \
				<&reset FORCE_RESET_H265_BPU>, \
				<&reset FORCE_RESET_H265_CORE>, \
				<&sysmem SYS_MEM_SD_H265>;
