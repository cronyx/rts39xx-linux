* Realtek H264 controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "realtek,rts3903-h264"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Phandle of the parent interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain the h264 interrupt number
- clocks: Clock for h264 controller
- clock-names: Name of clock
- clock-frequency : Clock frequency for h264 controller
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs, one pair for
each reset signal that affects the device
- reset-names: List of reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as
the resets property

Example:
	rts_h264_hx280enc@18060000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3903-h264";
		reg = <0x18060000 0x00020000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vecintc>;
		interrupts = <BSP_IRQ_H264>;
		clocks = <&clks RLX_CLK_H264_CK>;
		clock-names = "h264_clk";
		clock-frequency = <333333333>;
		resets = <&reset FORCE_RESET_H264>;
		reset-names = "h264_rst";
		status = "disabled";
	};
