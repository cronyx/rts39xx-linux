* Realtek Mjpeg controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "realtek,rts3903-jpgenc"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Phandle of the parent interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain the mjpeg interrupt number
- clocks: Clock for mjpeg controller
- clock-names: Name of clock
- clock-frequency : Clock frequency for mjpeg controller
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs, one pair for
each reset signal that affects the device
- reset-names: List of reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as
the resets property
- jpg-config: Configuration of mjpeg
- status: Either "ok" or "disabled"

Example:
	rts_mjpeg_enc: rts_jpgenc@1805e000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3903-jpgenc";
		reg = <0x1805e000 0x00002000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vecintc>;
		interrupts = <BSP_IRQ_MCU8051>;
		clocks = <&clks RLX_CLK_JPEG_CK>;
		clock-names = "jpeg_clk";
		clock-frequency = <100000000>;
		resets = <&reset FORCE_RESET_JPG>;
		reset-names = "jpeg_rst";
		jpg-config = <&jpgcfg>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
