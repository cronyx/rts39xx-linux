= Realtek RTS-EFUSE device tree bindings =

This binding is intended to represent RTS-EFUSE which is found in Realtek SOCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "realtek,rts3903-efuse"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of RTS-EFUSE, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	efuse: efuse@18865000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rts3903-efuse";
		reg = <0x18865000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.
