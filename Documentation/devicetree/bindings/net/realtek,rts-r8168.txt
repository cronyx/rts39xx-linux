* Realtek rts39xx SoC Ethernet controller

Required properties/subnode:
- compatible: Should be "realtek,rts3903-r8168"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Phandle of the parent interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet controller interrupt
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs, one pair for
each reset signal that affects the device.
- reset-names: List of reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as
the resets property.
- led_configs node: Ethernet status led configuration. Additional information is
below.

led_configs subnode indicates how the ethernet status leds work.
Required properties:
- led-pin: 1 means the led works, -1 means the led doesn't work.
- link-mode: led blinks whether ethernet works on 10M, 100M or 1000M mode.
- act-full: 1 means led works on all speed link, 0 means led works only on selected speed link.
- act-high-active: 1 means led high active, 0 means led low active.

Example:
	eth0: ethernet@31060000 {
			compatible = "realtek,rts3903-r8168";
			reg = <0x18400000 0x10000>;
			interrupt-parent = <&vecintc>;
			interrupts = <2>;

			resets = <&reset 17>, <&reset 18>;
			reset-names = "reset-eth", "reset-eth-clr";

			led_configs {
				led_config@0 {
					led-pin = <1>;
					link-mode = <100>;
					act-full = <1>;
					act-high-active = <0>;
				};
				led_config@1 {
					led-pin = <1>;
					link-mode = <100>;
					act-full = <1>;
					act-high-active = <0>;
				};
				led_config@2 {
					led-pin = <1>;
					link-mode = <100>;
					act-full = <1>;
					act-high-active = <0>;
				};
			};
	};
